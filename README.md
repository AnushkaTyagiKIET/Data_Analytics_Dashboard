**Key Points**
1. The primary goals of the sales analysis were to assess overall trends, evaluate the effectiveness of strategies, identify 
   performance disparities among 
   products and regions, and provide actionable recommendations for future growth.
2. Revenue showed a notable increase of 62.87% from 2018 to 2019, but growth slowed to just 1.19% in 2020, likely impacted by the 
   Covid-19 pandemic.
3. Seasonal analysis revealed higher sales during May-August and November-December, implying potential periods for boosting 
   marketing efforts.
4. Certain products, particularly Accessories and Rugs, generated the most revenue, while Bedroom Furniture and Bean Bags performed 
   poorly, indicating the need for a reevaluation of low-performing products.
5. The analysis of customer companies showed that over 50% generated revenue below the average, prompting recommendations for 
   customer segmentation and  performance focus.
6. The performance of sales representatives varied, revealing that some excelled in high-value deals while others consistently 
   closed medium-value sales, suggesting tailored training opportunities.
7. Regional sales performance indicated that Western and Southern states had the highest profitability, emphasizing the need for 
   strategic adjustments in Midwestern and Northeastern regions.

## Factors Contributing to Difference in Sales in different Region:

1. **Population Density**: Higher population density areas have more potential customers, leading to increased sales. This relationship is consistent across all regions studied.

2. **Household Income**: Regions with higher incomes typically have greater purchasing power, resulting in higher sales. However, Kylo’s A-Z company is particularly popular in areas with medium to low household income.

3. **Distribution Channels**: The effectiveness of sales channels impacts revenue. Kylo’s has four sales channels: In-store, Online, Distributor, and Wholesale. The In-store channel generates the highest revenue, while Wholesale generates the least. In the Western and Southern U.S. regions, In-store and Online dominate, whereas in the Midwestern and Northeastern regions, the sales channels contribute more evenly.

4. **Market Saturation**: Regions with many competitors may struggle to achieve high sales.

5. **Marketing and Advertising**: The success of marketing efforts can vary by region.

6. **Product Fit**: The product or service may better meet the needs of certain populations in specific regions.
